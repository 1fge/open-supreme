# Open Supreme
*Open Supreme* is a 100% open source requests-based Supreme program  

Created by [@internalises](https://twitter.com/internalises) (nested#0001)  
If you encounter any problems feel free to message me on Discord or Twitter.

## Features
* **<1 Second Checkout Times**  
* Unlimited Tasks that run concurrently
* Proxy support

## Installation
**Make sure you are using Python >=3.7.0**  
To Install Files:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1fge/open-supreme
```
To Install Required Modules:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  

## Usage
Unlike previous versions, the entire program can be interacted with using one file, osp.py. This script can be accessed by opening the command prompt in the open-supreme folder and typing: 
```bash
python osp.py
```
After successfully getting osp.py to run, make sure you create at least one profile before attempting to make tasks. As mentioned above, you can run with as many tasks and profiles as you want. Note: Don't try to edit **tasks.json** or **profiles.json** without osp.py as it could cause breaking changes.

When you are ready to start your tasks, go to the main menu and input `2` or `Open-Supreme`. Then, type `run` and the bot will start! To stop your tasks, just hit enter.
  

## Important Information 
1. This bot will fail while ticket is enforced as it has no ticket workaround.
2. *Open Supreme* only works in the U.S. Other regions may be added later. 
3. Color names must be exact matches otherwise the program won't find your item (not case-sensitive)

## TODO
- [x] Implement Captcha Harvester
- [ ] Support More Regions
- [ ] Add Descriptive Error Handling
